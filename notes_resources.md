### Shader Shop
+ Cool website where to experiment with functions commonly found in shaders in a graphical manner. Those functions are also used inside F3 to generate shapes.

Link to website's short tutorials:

### Inigo Quilez sdf
+ Inigo Quilez is a master of shader and ray tracing development. In his website he talks really in depth about how to create visuals using signed distance functions.

In this page he sums up some sdf for common shapes (these are the same used in F3):

### Klein Bottle
  + Example of non-orientable surface: normal vectors cannot be consistently defined.
  + It is one sided surface.
  + Other related non-orientable objects include the *Möbius Strip*.
  + A Klein Bottle has no boundary where the surface stops abruptly.   
  + While the Möbius Strip can be embedded in 3 dimensional Euclidean space, the Klein Bottle cannot. It can be embedded in a 4 dimensional space however (4th dimension could be time).

### Penrose Triangle
+ It's an impossible object.
+ Appears to be a solid object, made of three straight beams of square cross-section which meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices of the triangle they form.
+ This combination of properties cannot be realized by any 3-dimensional object in ordinary Euclidean space.
+ Such an object can exist in certain Euclidean 3-manifolds.
+ If a line is traced around the Penrose triangle, a 3-loop Möbius strip is formed.
